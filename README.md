# TSP
Solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem using local search optimization algorithm in combination with multilevel paradigm to improve quality.

*TSP-coordinates*: Cities are assigned a random x value and a random y value between a min and a max value, and has distance calculated through euclidian algorithm.
*TSP-distance*: All city pairs are assigned a distance between 1 and 5 between them
